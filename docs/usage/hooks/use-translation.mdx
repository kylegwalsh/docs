## Usage

The `useTranslation()` hook is helpful for translating text when you can't rely on a component wrapper.

Simply provide the string you want to translate as the first argument of the hook in order to translate it.

You can also provide additional options as the second argument to adjust how translations are handled (the same way you can control translations in the `<TranslatedText />` component).

For example, this hook could be useful when translating one of the properties you are using in another component (like a screen title).

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from '@lexiconjs/react'
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router'
import React from 'react'

export default function TabLayout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          title: useTranslation('Track', { context: 'Track my progress' }).translation,
        }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="profile"
        options={{
          title: useTranslation('Profile').translation,
        }}
      />
    </Tabs>
  )
}
```

## Response

This hook returns several fields.

<ResponseField name="translation" type="string">
The translation of the provided input string.

If the translation fails, it will fall back to the original string that was provided.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
Provides the result status of the translation as a string.

Possible values: "loading" | "success" | "error"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isLoading" type="boolean">
Whether the translation is currently loading.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isSuccess" type="boolean">
Whether the translation was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isError" type="boolean">
Whether the translation experienced an error.

In this scenario, the `translation` field will fall back to the original string that was provided.
</ResponseField>
