description: "Use the `useTranslation()` hook to translate text outside of a component wrapper."

## Usage

The `useTranslation()` hook is helpful for translating text when you can't rely on a component wrapper.

Simply provide the string you want to translate as the first argument of the hook to translate it.

You can also provide additional options as the second argument to adjust how translations are handled (the same way you can control translations in the `<TranslatedText />` component).

For example, this hook could be useful when translating one of the properties you are using in another component (like a screen title).

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from '@lexiconjs/react'
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router'
import React from 'react'

export default function TabLayout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          title: useTranslation('Track', { context: 'Track my progress' }).translation,
        }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="profile"
        options={{
          title: useTranslation('Profile').translation,
        }}
      />
    </Tabs>
  )
}
```

## Response

This hook returns several fields.

<ResponseField name="translation" type="string">
The translation of the provided input string.

If the translation fails, it will fall back to the original string that was provided.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
Provides the result status of the translation as a string.

Possible values: "loading" | "success" | "error"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isLoading" type="boolean">
Whether the translation is currently loading.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isSuccess" type="boolean">
Whether the translation was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isError" type="boolean">
Whether the translation experienced an error.

In this scenario, the `translation` field will fall back to the original string that was provided.
</ResponseField>

## Options

This hook accepts various secondary options.

<ResponseField name="context" type="string">
Any additional context/guidance that you would like to provide to the translator.

This is most commonly used when you are translating a single word that can be interpreted in multiple different ways. However, it can also be useful if you want to slightly tweak how translations are being generated.

For example, you can provide the `context` "Track my progress" when the child string is "Track".
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="disableTranslation" type="boolean" default="false">
Whether to disable the translation of the string within the `useTranslation()`.

You probably won't use this option as much on the `useTranslation()` hook as you would on the `<TranslatedText />` component.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
The current locale of the text we'd like to translate (the language you wrote the app in).

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `defaultLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />`.*

Example: `en-US`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
The locale we would like to translate the text to.

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `targetLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />` (which defaults to the user's detected locale).*

Example: `es-ES`
</ResponseField>
