## Usage

The `useTranslator()` hook provides access to the underlying `translate` method, but you really shouldn't be using it very often. However, it is helpful in niche situations where you need to translate text on the fly (outside of standard component text or hooks).

To use it, simply call the hook and extract the `translate` method. Then, you can call the `translate` method wherever you like in your code (such as in an effect).

It can be useful in scenarios where you need finer grain control over translations, but most scenarios can be addressed via the `useTranslation()` hook.

It's first argument should be the string you'd like to translate. You can also provide additional options as the second argument to adjust how translations are handled (the same way you can control translations in the `<TranslatedText />` component).

```tsx
import { useTranslator } from '@lexiconjs/react'
import { Alert } from 'react-native'
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

export const useMyNicheHook = () => {
  // Grab the underlying translate function
  const { translate } = useTranslator();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Make some kind of call that returns a string
    const untranslatedString = retrieveString();

    // Translate that string and show an alert
    translate(untranslatedString)
      .then(({ translation }) => {
        Alert.alert(translation)
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error('Failed to translate', err)
      })
  }, [])
}
```

*Keep in mind that this method is asynchronous and returns a promise.*

## Response

This hook returns a single function.

<ResponseField name="translate" type="func">
The underlying translate method used by the library.

This is the same method that is invoked by `useTranslation()` and `<TranslatedText />` and provides a finer level of control in certain situations.

If the translation fails, it will fall back to the original string that was provided.

<Accordion title='"translate" Method Usage'>
The `translate` method is very similar to the `useTranslation()` hook and accepts the same options.

### Options

<ResponseField name="context" type="string">
Any additional context / guidance that you would like to provide to the translator.

This is most commonly used when you are translating a single word that can be interpreted multiple different ways. However, it can also be useful if you want to slightly tweak how translations are being generated.

For example, you can provide the `context` "Track my progress" when the child string is "Track".
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
The current locale of the text we'd like to translate (the language you wrote the app in).

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `defaultLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />`.*

Example: `en-US`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
The locale we would like to translate the text to.

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `targetLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />` (which defaults to the user's detected locale).*

Example: `es-ES`
