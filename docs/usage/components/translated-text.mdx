The `<TranslatedText />` component is the bread and butter of this library. It wraps simple strings and automatically translates them to the user's detected locale at run time.

## Usage

You can use this component to translate a text string by simply wrapping the string in your code. 

```tsx
<Text>
</Text>
```

We usually recommend creating a `<Text />` component in your codebase so that these translations happen automatically behind the scenes. You can set it up to accept a `translationOptions` prop or something similar to pass down any desired translation settings.

```tsx

```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="context" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="disableTranslation" type="boolean">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="disableContextualTranslation" type="boolean">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enableSkeleton" type="boolean">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="skeletonColor" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
The current locale of the text we'd like to translate (the language you wrote the app in).

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `defaultLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />`.*

Example: `en-US`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
The locale we would like to translate the text to.

*You should almost never provide this prop because it is set based on the `targetLanguage` prop provided to the `<TranslationProvider />` (which defaults to the user's detected locale).*

Example: `es-ES`
</ResponseField>
