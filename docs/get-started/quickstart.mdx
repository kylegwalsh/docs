This quick start guide will get you up and running with Lexicon.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

<Step title="Create a Lexicon account">

Go to [app.lexiconjs.com](https://app.lexiconjs.com) and create a free account.

</Step>

<Step title="Get your publishable key">

Grab your publishable key from your dashboard's [API Keys](https://app.lexiconjs.com/keys) tab and save it for later.

</Step>

<Step title="Install the @lexiconjs/react module">

Add the **@lexiconjs/react** package to your existing project.

In a terminal window run:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @lexiconjs/react --save
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @lexiconjs/react --save
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @lexiconjs/react
```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
Note: If you are using **expo**, you will need to use the [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-builds-with-expo-dev-client) in order to run this library locally.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Wrap your app in <TranslationProvider />">

The `<TranslationProvider />` component enables the automatic translation of your app's text inside of other components. Import it into your codebase by adding `import { TranslationProvider } from "@lexiconjs/react"` at the top of your entry file and then wrap your app with it.

```tsx
import { TranslationProvider } from "@lexiconjs/react"
import React from "react"
import App from "./component/App"

export const TranslatedApp = () => {
  return (
    <TranslationProvider 
      defaultLanguage="en-US" 
      token={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
    >
      <App />
    </TranslationProvider>
  )
}
```

*Make sure to replace the `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with the key you found in your dashboard.*

</Step>

<Step title="Use Lexicon components to translate your app">

The simplest way to translate text is to simply wrap some text with the `<TranslatedText />` component. It will detect the user's locale via their device settings and generate a translation in real time. Afterward, it stores the translation in a local cache to ensure everything stays as fast as possible.

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { Text } from "react-native"

export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Text>
      <TranslatedText>
        This text will be translated!
      </TranslatedText>
    </Text>
  )
}
```

<Tip>
We recommend extending the `<Text />` component from whatever component library you're using into a custom component so that you don't need to include `<TranslatedText />` everywhere.

See the [TranslatedText documentation](/docs/usage/components/translated-text#creating-a-custom-text-component) for more details.
