## Overview

Nested formatting is when you style certain words within a block of text differently from the rest. This is usually one of the biggest headaches when dealing with traditional translation methods. However, Lexicon handles it automatically.

For example, once you've [created your custom text component](/docs/usage/components/translated-text#creating-a-custom-text-component), you can simply use it as you'd use normal `<Text />` components.

```tsx
<Text>Nested formatting helps you <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>emphasize text</Text></Text>
```

This will be automatically translated as a single block of text and then re-injected with the appropriate styles. This helps to ensure no context is lost when performing translations (which might happen if you translated the two pieces of text individually).

## How it Works

We handle nested translations by transforming component trees into arrays of elements.

To provide further clarity, let's go over an example.

Given the components below...

```tsx
<Text>Nested formatting helps you <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>emphasize text</Text></Text>
```

We would generate a string template like `Nested formatting helps you <1>emphasize text</1>`. The `<1>` refers to the corresponding child in the component tree so that we can keep track of it.

We would then translate that block of text into the desired language (say `es-ES`). This would give us a translated template like `El formato anidado te ayuda a <1>enfatizar el texto</1>`.

Finally, we would inject the proper translations, resulting in...

```tsx
<Text>El formato anidado te ayuda a <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>enfatizar el texto</Text></Text>
```

By handling all this under the hood, you don't need to worry about managing the translations yourself!
